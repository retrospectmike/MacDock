# MacDock
## Note on file compatibility:
These files were made on a classic Macintosh environment.  This means they had both a `data fork` and a `resource fork` which are not properly maintained in modern OSes -- **so do not trust the files in this repository!** 
## SO how do I use these files?
Use the `MacDock_v1.0.sit` file, transfer it to your classic Macintosh environment, unstuff it, and you can use the files.

## File listing:
* DockApp - the THINKC 5.0 project file
* all .c / .h files - Source code files for the app
* DockApp.rsrc - resource file to be assembled into the application
* MacDock - compiled application
* README.md - a classic Macintosh edition of this read me (see below).

MacDock 1.0 ©2023 by MacOfAllTrades
Dedicated to those of us still using these machines 40 years later...

System Requirements:
¥ System 7

Description:
MacDock is like the Dock in modern macOS.
To use it, simply launch the program.  MacDock will be visible at the bottom of your screen.  

You will see your running applications on the list (limited to 7 applications).  

Clicking on any of them switches you to the app.

Options:
¥ Auto Hide (CMD+H) - Tucks away the Dock partially when the app is not in focus, for easier viewing of MacDock behind cluttered desktops
¥ Show in Dock (CMD+D) - Shows MacDock in the dock
