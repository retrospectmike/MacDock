Description:
MacDock is like the Dock in modern macOS.
To use it, simply launch the program.  MacDock will be visible at the bottom of your screen.  

You will see your running applications on the list (limited to 7 applications).  

Clicking on any of them switches you to the app.

Options:
¥ Auto Hide (CMD+H) - Tucks away the Dock partially when the app is not in focus, for easier viewing of MacDock behind cluttered desktops
¥ Show in Dock (CMD+D) - Shows MacDock in the dock
