System Requirements:
* System 7.x - MacOS 8 (MacOS 9 incompatible)
* AppleScript with Finder Scripting Extension for full features

Description:
MacDock is like the Dock in modern macOS but for System 7 and 8.
To use it, simply launch the program.  MacDock will be visible at the bottom of your screen.  

You will see your running applications on the list, limited to 16 applications.  Beyond that, the program may become unstable but willl continue to run.  

* Clicking on any of them switches you to the app.
* Cmd + clicking reveals that application in the Finder
* Option + clicking hides the current application and switches to the clicked application (only when clicking from a non-MacDock application)

Options:
* Small Dock (Cmd+S) - Toggles the small dock
* Show Self in Dock (Cmd+D) - Shows MacDock app in the dock
