System Requirements:
* System 7.x - MacOS 8.x
* AppleScript with Finder Scripting Extension for full features

Description:
MacDock is like the Dock in modern macOS but for System 7 and 8.
To use it, simply launch the program.  MacDock will be visible at the bottom of your screen.  

You will see your running applications on the list (limited to 7 applications).  

* Clicking on any of them switches you to the app.
* Cmd + clicking reveals that application in the Finder
* Option + clicking hides the current application and switches to the clicked application (only when clicking from a non-MacDock application)

Options:
* Auto Hide (Cmd+H) - Tucks away the Dock partially when the app is not in focus, for easier viewing of MacDock behind cluttered desktops
* Show in Dock (Cmd+D) - Shows MacDock in the dock
